  Our creative idea is to create a smart legal chatbot that is integrated into an easy-to-use platform. This would give lawyers instant access to legal information and remove the need for laborious manual research in books or regulations. With the use of sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs), this chatbot provides legal practitioners with a rapid and effective means to get immediate responses to their questions.
 The chatbot's comprehension of intricate legal jargon will allow attorneys to ask queries in plain English and get accurate, situation-appropriate answers. It will make use of machine learning algorithms to enhance its accuracy over time and stay current with changes and revisions to the law.

### Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/anish2105/oneAPI-GenAI-Hackathon-2023.git
```
 Create a virtual envirnoment
 1. Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment. For example:
```bash
  cd path/to/your/project
```
 2. Use the following command to create a virtual environment named venv:
```bash
  python -m venv venv
```
 3. To activate the virtual environment, navigate to the Scripts directory inside the venv folder and run the activate script. Use the following command:
```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
```
Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the server

```bash
  python app.py
```
---
 4. To deactivate the virtual environment,  Use the following command:
```bash
  deactivate
``` 
### Future Scope:
*    Further improvements to the user interface are required.
*    A variety of open-source embeddings are available for use.
*    We are currently utilizing a dataset that only includes information about women and children, but we plan to eventually add the entire constitution.
