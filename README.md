### Tech Stack: 
*    Python 
*    Langchain
*    Flask/FastAPI 
*    JavaScript 
*    Intel® oneAPI Data Analytics Library
*    Intel® Optimization for PyTorch
*    Large Language Models
*    Intel developer cloud
*    Streamlit
*    OpenAI (for embedding)

### Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  This Section must contain a set of instructions required to clone and run the prototype so that it can be tested and deeply analyzed
  
### Future Scope:
*    Further improvements to the user interface are required.
*    A variety of open-source embeddings are available for use.
*    We are currently utilizing a dataset that only includes information about women and children, but we plan to eventually add the entire constitution.
