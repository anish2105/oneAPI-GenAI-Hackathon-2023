### An Overview of the Prototype:

  ![image](https://github.com/anish2105/oneAPI-GenAI-Hackathon-2023/assets/75316315/1d085823-7d11-4d68-8f98-eb510f33b605)
  Our creative idea is to create a smart legal chatbot that is integrated into an easy-to-use platform. This would give lawyers instant access to legal information and remove the need for laborious manual research in books or regulations. With the use of sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs), this chatbot provides legal practitioners with a rapid and effective means to get immediate responses to their questions.
 The chatbot's comprehension of intricate legal jargon will allow attorneys to ask queries in plain English and get accurate, situation-appropriate answers. It will make use of machine learning algorithms to enhance its accuracy over time and stay current with changes and revisions to the law.
